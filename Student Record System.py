# This code implements a simple Student Record System that allows users to add, view, and search for student records.
# It uses a text file to store student data, ensuring that records persist between program runs.
# The system is designed to be user-friendly, providing clear prompts and feedback for each action.
# The code is structured with a `Student` class to represent individual student records
